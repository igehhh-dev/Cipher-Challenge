# Cipher-Challenge
Using Asymmetric Algorithm
Step 1: Initialized npm with the
 npm init
  and created a cipher.js file in the folder directory
For this project, Node-RSA package module was used 
RSA works by generating a public and a private key. The public and private keys are generated together and form a key pair. The public key can be used to encrypt any arbitrary piece of data, but cannot decrypt it.The private key can be used to decrypt any piece of data that was encrypted by itâ€™s corresponding public key.

Step 2: Node RSA package was installed using command: 
npm install node-rsa

Step 3: To require the node-rsa module using: 
const NodeRSA = require('node-rsa')
